There are two files: Both have different style blocks and learning style 

     First file has my initial game which I made without AI 6 month ago and I implement AI on this

     Second file have some changes in blocks design and some agent State and Step functions code. 

Both the file has Training, Agent, and Game code. 
when we run the training file the agent starts learning the game.
